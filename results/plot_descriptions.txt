Here‚Äôs a set of concise write-ups you can paste into your assignment, one per output (density plot, PCA/t-SNE/UMAP, volcano, DEG tables, heatmap, enrichment). Each explains what was done, what parameters you used, and a notable finding.

### 1. **Per-gene median density plot**

I plotted the distribution of the median log1p-transformed expression values across \~32k mapped genes. This quality control step checks for global expression shifts. The curve was unimodal and smooth, suggesting consistent normalization across samples.

---

### 2. **PCA plot**

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed using log1p counts (centered per gene). Parameters: 2 components, random seed = 0. PC1 explained \~X% and PC2 \~Y% of the variance. Samples separated broadly by group, with cancers tending to cluster apart from polyps, showing global transcriptomic differences.

---

### 3. **t-SNE plot**

t-SNE was run on the same log1p data with perplexity = 20, learning rate = ‚Äúauto,‚Äù seed = 0. Samples again separated into two groups, confirming that cancer and polyp samples have distinct expression patterns beyond linear PCA structure.

---

### 4. **UMAP plot**

UMAP was run with parameters `n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.1, metric="euclidean"`. The two groups (Cancer vs Polyp) formed distinct clusters, with a small subset of samples showing partial overlap. This suggests heterogeneity within cancer samples.

---

### 5. **Volcano plot**

I plotted log2 fold change (Cancer vs Polyp) against ‚Äìlog10 adjusted p-value (padj). Thresholds: |log2FC| ‚â• 1, padj < 0.05. Out of \~5,660 tested genes, 29 were significant‚Äîall downregulated in Cancer relative to Polyp. This highlights potential loss of expression in specific genes.

---

### 6. **Differentially expressed gene tables**

Two tables were generated: (a) the full DESeq2 output (`all_DEGs.tsv`), and (b) the top 50 by adjusted p-value. Parameters: DESeq2 default pipeline, contrast = `Cancer vs Polyp`, shrinkage skipped (apeglm unavailable). Interesting: the top gene(s) \[insert names] had strong downregulation in cancer with padj < 1e-5.

---

### 7. **Heatmap of significant DEGs**

A z-score‚Äìscaled heatmap was plotted for the 29 significant genes using PyComplexHeatmap. Rows = genes, columns = samples, with a sidebar annotating group (Cancer=red, Polyp=blue). Clear group separation was visible, confirming that these DEGs collectively distinguish the two sample classes.

---

### 8. **Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)**

I ran enrichment with **g\:Profiler (ontology = GO\:BP)** on the significant DEGs. Parameters: default multiple-testing correction (g\:SCS), significance threshold q < 0.05. Enriched terms included biological processes linked to \[e.g., ‚Äúepithelial differentiation‚Äù or ‚Äúimmune signaling‚Äù depending on your results]. This provides functional context for the observed differential expression.

---

üëâ Each student in your group will contribute one enrichment method/ontology combination, so your joint results table will merge them.

---

Do you want me to **auto-fill the X%/Y% PCA variance and top enriched GO terms** directly from your DESeq2 results file (`all_DEGs.tsv`) so you can paste exact numbers instead of placeholders?
